## About the project

### Getting started with CI/CD

Getting build and deployment pipelines in place has been a great help in previous projects. I want to try to leverage that from the start of this project. As a first step in the project, I have added a Github action to deploy to the gh-pages branch. [Here are some links about Github actions in general, and for setting up actions for this project.](learning/cicd.md)
